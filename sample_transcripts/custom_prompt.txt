"Hi there! Please scan this QR code first so we can get you into our system for the networking event later this week."

"No problem, just did it. I’ve been following your firm’s work in infrastructure for a while. I’m a graduating senior looking for entry-level roles in project coordination."

"Great. Do you have a physical copy of your resume handy? I’d like to jot a few notes on it."

"Right here. I’ve spent the last summer as a junior analyst, so I’m really looking to hit the ground running."

"Perfect. We’re actually doing a batch of first-round screens tomorrow. I’ll make a note that we spoke. Have a good one!"

"Hey! How are you holding up? It’s pretty loud in here today, isn't it?"

"It’s definitely energetic! I’m doing well, though. I was really excited to see your company on the list today. I’ve been using your software for my capstone project."

"Oh, really? That’s awesome to hear. I’m actually on the development team, not HR. What do you think of the new API documentation?"

"It’s much cleaner than the previous version, though I did have a few questions about the authentication headers. Is that something the intern team gets to work on?"

"Actually, yes. We let our interns dive right into the codebase. Tell you what—skip the general portal and email me your GitHub link directly. Here’s my card."

"Hello. Are you in the Engineering or Construction management track?"

"I’m actually a Data Science major, but I noticed your company is heavily investing in predictive maintenance for your fleet."

"Ah, I see. To be honest, we’re primarily here for the field engineers today. I don't have a lot of info on the tech side of things."

"I understand. Is there a specific office or a lead for the R&D department I could reach out to online?"

"Your best bet is our headquarters in Chicago. If you apply through the 'Specialist' portal, it goes to that team. Sorry I couldn't be more help!"

"Hi... sorry, let me just finish this note. Okay, how can I help you?"

"No worries at all, I can imagine it’s been a long morning! I’m interested in the Marketing Analyst position. I’ve focused my studies on consumer behavior and SQL."

"Right, okay. We are looking for people who can start in June. Are you open to relocating to the East Coast?"

"I am definitely open to relocation. I’ve actually lived in three different states, so I’m used to the move."

"Good to know. Leave your resume here. We’ll be reaching out to candidates by next Friday if there's a match."

"Come on over! We’re building a new team for our fintech startup. Do you like fast-paced environments, or do you prefer a more structured corporate vibe?"

"I definitely thrive in the fast-paced stuff. I’ve worked on three different volunteer projects this year where I had to teach myself the tools as I went."

"That’s what we like to hear. We don't have 'job descriptions' as much as we have 'problems that need solving.' What’s a problem you’ve solved recently?"

"I actually had to automate a reporting process for a local non-profit that was taking them ten hours a week. I got it down to ten minutes with a custom script."

"Love that. Here’s my phone number—text me your LinkedIn profile and let's grab coffee later this week."

"Good afternoon. Please place your resume in the 'Intern' bin. What is your current GPA?"

"I’m at a 3.8. I’ve balanced that while working a part-time job and leading the student investment club."

"Impressive. We have a very strict training program that begins in July. Are you available for a full 10-week stint in New York?"

"Yes, I’ve already cleared my summer schedule for a full-time internship. Is the program rotation-based or fixed to one desk?"

"It’s a rotation for the first four weeks, then you’re placed based on performance. Thank you for stopping by."

"Hi! Just a heads up, we don't take paper resumes. You’ll need to apply on our website to be considered."

"I completely understand. I actually already submitted my application last night! I’m here because I wanted to ask about the team culture."

"Oh, you’re ahead of the game! In that case, let’s chat. What specifically do you want to know about working with us?"

"I saw that your company has a big emphasis on mentorship. How does that actually look for someone in their first six months?"

"It’s pretty robust. You’re assigned a 'buddy' who isn't your boss, so you can ask the 'silly' questions without any pressure. It really helped me when I started."

"Hello. We are looking for candidates who are U.S. citizens for our security clearances. Does that apply to you?"

"Yes, it does. I’ve been interested in public service for a while and would love to apply my technical skills to government projects."

"Great. The process can take about six to nine months because of the background checks. Are you looking for something immediately or after graduation?"

"I graduate in May, so the timeline actually works out well for me. What does the typical day look like for a junior analyst in your department?"

"It’s a lot of data verification and reporting, but you’re working on projects that actually impact national policy. Here is a brochure with the specific steps for the clearance."

"Hi! Do you have a portfolio or a website I can look at? We’re a creative agency, so we like to see the work."

"I do! I have a QR code right here on my resume that links to my design portfolio. I specialize in UX for mobile apps."

"Awesome. Let me take a look... Oh, I like the clean layout on this travel app project. Did you do the prototyping yourself?"

"I did. I used Figma for the wireframes and conducted user testing with about fifteen people to refine the navigation."

"That’s exactly the kind of process we look for. I’m going to pass your link to our Creative Director tonight."

"We’re looking for people who are passionate about sustainability. Does that align with your career goals?"

"Absolutely. I’ve taken several electives in environmental economics because I want to work for a company that prioritizes the triple bottom line."

"That’s great to hear. Most students just ask about the salary. We’re looking for research interns for our carbon offset program."

"I actually read your company’s recent impact report. The way you’re measuring soil health is fascinating. Is that a collaborative project?"

"It is! We work with several universities. You’re very well-prepared. Let’s make sure we have your contact info before you leave."

"I’m the Engineering Lead for our cloud team. Quick question: how would you explain a 'container' to someone who isn't technical?"

"I’d say it’s like a shipping container for software. It holds everything the program needs to run, so you can move it from a ship to a train to a truck without worrying about what’s inside changing."

"Not bad. We get a lot of people who know the buzzwords but can't explain the logic. Are you comfortable with Linux environments?"

"Yes, I’ve been using a Linux distro as my primary OS for about two years now. I'm very comfortable with the command line."

"Good. We need more people who aren't afraid of the terminal. Here’s my direct email—send me your resume and mention we talked about the shipping container analogy."

"Hi! I’ve got a panel I have to speak at in five minutes, so give me your best 30-second pitch."

"I’m a problem-solver who just finished a project managing a 10-person team for a campus-wide event. I reduced our overhead costs by 20% while increasing student engagement."

"I like the numbers. What’s the one thing you want to do in your first year of a job?"

"I want to master your internal workflow so I can start identifying bottlenecks and suggesting efficiency improvements."

"Fair enough. Give my colleague here your resume and tell him I said to put a star on it. I’ve gotta run!"

"I’m from the HR department, so I handle everything from accounting to operations. Which area were you looking into?"

"I’m interested in the Supply Chain Coordinator role. I’ve had a previous internship where I assisted with vendor management and logistics."

"Oh, perfect. We’re actually expanding that department right now. Are you familiar with any ERP software?"

"I’ve used SAP in my last role for inventory tracking, and I’m a quick learner when it comes to new platforms."

"That’s a huge plus. I’ll make sure the hiring manager for logistics sees your resume specifically."

"We can teach the technical stuff, but we can't teach 'culture fit.' Tell me about a time you had to deal with a difficult teammate."

"In my last group project, we had someone who wasn't meeting deadlines. Instead of going to the professor, I sat down with them to see if they were struggling with the material."

"And what happened?"

"Turns out they were. I spent a few hours tutoring them on the basics, and we ended up finishing the project on time with an A. It taught me that communication usually solves most conflicts."

"I love that answer. We’re a very collaborative office, so that’s exactly what we want to hear."

"It’s been a pleasure meeting you today. You’ve got a great background. What are your next steps for the job hunt?"

"I’m looking to have a position secured by the end of the semester. I’m very interested in your firm, so I’ll be following up with an email tomorrow morning."

"Sounds like a plan. Is there anything else you need from me before you head to the next booth?"

"Just a business card if you have one, or the best way to stay in touch. I really enjoyed learning about your new initiative."

"Here you go. Looking forward to seeing your email. Good luck with the rest of the fair!"
